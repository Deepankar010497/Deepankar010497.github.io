## 🧠 Projects & Work Highlights

### 🔹 Multi-Agent AI System for SDLC Intelligence  
    - Designed and deployed a production-grade multi-agent LLM system using LangGraph and AutoGen to orchestrate intelligent agents for extracting insights from both structured and unstructured SDLC data.  
    - Architected a dynamic planner–orchestrator–responder workflow that enabled the system to identify use cases in real time, trigger API-based tool calls, and generate a sequence of contextual payloads tailored to user personas. The system supported complex inference generation by integrating agent reasoning with SDLC-specific data pipelines.  
    - Integrated as a scalable microservice into the enterprise platform for live query handling and dynamic insight delivery.  
**Tech Stack:** LangGraph, AutoGen, LLMs, API Tool Calling, Prompt Engineering, Microservice Deployment, Docker, AKS

### 🔹 Hybrid RAG for Unified Data Retrieval  
Built a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline to query both structured and unstructured data. Combined semantic chunking, vector-based search, and graph traversal techniques to enable context-rich LLM responses. Used this in internal platforms to enable document-level and metadata-driven querying.  
**Tech Stack:** LangChain, ChromaDB, Elasticsearch, LLMs, Semantic Chunking, Flask

### 🔹 Predictive Infra Monitoring & Anomaly Detection  
Led the development of a time-series forecasting and anomaly detection pipeline for infrastructure metrics. Benchmarked and deployed NeuralProphet and LightGBM models to predict dynamic load patterns and detect critical anomalies. Integrated insights into GenAI agents for root cause analysis and early alerting.  
**Tech Stack:** NeuralProphet, LightGBM, Python, Time Series Analysis, RAG, AKS

### 🔹 Intelligent Document-to-text, OCR & Image-to-Text Pipeline  
Created a modular pipeline for extracting structured text from noisy documents and images using html tags, Tesseract OCR, OpenCV, and LLM-based prompt generation. This system handled text, images, tables, and layout variations—powering document understanding workflows in downstream AI agents.  
**Tech Stack:** Tesseract, OpenCV, LLMs, Gradio, Semantic Parsing, Prompt Engineering

### 🔹 Regression Test Case Optimization (LTI Internship)  
Developed a content-based recommender system to prioritize regression test cases using TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and topic modeling. Reduced test cycle time and improved QA productivity. Delivered models as part of a regional vs full-regression testing strategy.  
**Tech Stack:** Python, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, LDA, NMF, Scikit-learn, Recommender Systems
